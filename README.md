1. Logistic Regression
Description:
Logistic Regression is a linear model used for binary classification problems. It estimates the probability that a given input belongs to a certain class. The algorithm uses a logistic function (sigmoid) to model the probability of the default class


2. Random Forest Classifier
Description:
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method used for classification (and regression) tasks. It operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes for classification. It helps in improving the predictive accuracy and controls overfitting.
